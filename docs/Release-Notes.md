# Release Notes

## May 21, 2025
### 🚀 New

This release introduces a new API endpoint which can be used together with the Smart Upload feature to fetch localized extract guidance based on the selected accounting package (connector) and data scope. It helps guide users through downloading the correct reports from their accounting systems by providing tailored instructions. This ensures users have the right files prepared before proceeding with their upload, improving accuracy and reducing friction during the data import process.

- Introduced API endpoint to retrieve localized extract guidance per connector and scope.
- Implemented fallback to default guidance when package-specific content is missing.
- Guidance supports multiple locales: en-GB, en-US, en-CA, fr-FR, fr-CA.
- Multi-scope requests return package-specific or default guidance as applicable.
- Guidance records require structured metadata including ID, connector, scope, update date, source, and localized HTML content.
